===============================

This Frogger-type game uses object-oriented Javascript techniques such as pseudoclassical patterns with superclasses and subclasses.  

It takes keyboard input of up, down, left, right.  The player must reach the water without "colliding" with the insect enemies!

The challenge is part of [Udacity's Object-Oriented Javascript course](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015).  Game development instructions can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub).
